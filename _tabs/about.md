## 关于这个博客

这是我的个人博客, 记录我的生活, 工作和想法. 我从2004年开始写这个博客, 已经写了20多年了. 我写的内容很广泛, 包括技术, 编程, 旅行, 美食等等. 希望你喜欢阅读我的博客, 就像我喜欢写博客一样.

我在2004年开始写这个博客, 当时我还是一个大学四年级的软件工程专业的学生. 那时候博客还很新鲜, 我想把我的想法和经历分享给世界. 这些年来, 我的生活经历了很多变化, 从一个单身学生变成了一个已婚有孩子的男人... 但是我的博客一直是我表达自己和与他人联系的地方.

这些年来, 我曾经写得很频繁, 有时候甚至每天都写. 但是随着微博和微信等社交平台的流行, 我发现自己在博客上写得越来越少了. 现在我只在这里写一些长篇大论的文章, 但是我也会在微信 / Facebook / Instagram 上分享一些短小精悍的想法和更新. 我觉得这两种形式都有自己的优势, 我喜欢使用它们.

这个博客本身也经历了很多变化. 我最初使用一个简单的博客平台, 但是后来为了更好地控制设计和性能, 我切换到了一个静态网站生成器. 我有一篇关于我的博客历史和演变的文章, 你可以在[这里]({% post_url 2023/2023-10-01-博客搬家-cloudflare试用 %})阅读.

## About this blog

This is my personal blog, where I write about my life, work, and thoughts. I started this blog in 2004, and have been writing here for over 20 years. I write about a wide range of topics, including technology, programming, travel, food, and more. I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy writing it.

I started this blog in 2004, when I was a 4th year university student in software enginnering. At that time, blogging was still a new phenomenon, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. Over the years, my life has evolved and changed, I changed from being a bachelor student to being a master, PhD students, a teacher in University, a married man with children... but my blog has always been a place for me to express myself and connect with others.

Over the years, I used to write quite often, sometimes even daily. However, as microblogging platforms like Weibo and WeChat became popular, I found myself writing less frequently on my blog. Nowadays, I just keep long posts here, but I also use WeChat / Facebook / Instagram to share shorter thoughts and updates. I think both formats have their own advantages, and I enjoy using them all.

The blog itself has evolved over the years as well. I started with a simple blogging platform, but eventually switched to a static site generator to have more control over the design and performance. I have an article about the history of my blog and how it evolved, which you can read [here]({% post_url /2023/2023-10-01-博客搬家-cloudflare试用 %}).
