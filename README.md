This is my personal website. It's written in Markdown and static HTMLs are generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

New articles are deployed to Google Firebase automatically with Github Actions when committed.

## Migration from Pelican

This blog was previously powered by Pelican (Python-based static site generator). It has been migrated to Jekyll (Ruby-based) for better GitHub Pages compatibility.

- Posts directory: `_posts/` (Jekyll standard)
- Old Pelican content: remains in `content/` backup
- Theme: Custom Jekyll theme
