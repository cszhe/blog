依依不舍的告别了微软全球技术中心，开始了我新的生活。八个月充实又充满激情的工作就这么告一段落了。把同事们对我的鼓励，放在这里，作为永远激励我前进的动力。

Good luck and keep contact!

Have a good time with your education and wish you a bright future, Jason. This may not be a farewell. Maybe sometime later we’ll be happy to see you again in Microsoft.

Dear all, 

It is the last week of my internship in GTEC. My postgraduate mentor forces me to go to his company next week.

I began my internship here at 24 June last year. How time flies, eight months has passed and DSV team has given a deep impression. People here are really kind and friendly. First, I would like to express my appreciation of your help to me. Thank you Santo my mentor, Xiao, Leo, Felix, Perry, Robert and all other teammates. Without your excellent help, I can not imagine what would happen.

It is really a challenging and rewarding internship, I have learned a lot from all of you. Also I have experienced many “my first time” during this period. First time interview, First time work for a company, first time get salary&#8230;&#8230; I think this is my most wonderful period of my life. I will forever remember it.

You can contact me via my MSN: xxx@msn.com or mobile phone: 138xxxxxxxx

Best Regards

Jason He
